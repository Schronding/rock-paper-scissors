# rock-paper-scissors

In this project I learned about:
- How I could use functions for a real application: 
- That my functions can be self-explanatory, so I and others can understand the code better. 
- In case there is a problem, I can more easily pinpoint where I need to work, mainly by watching the error messages when they pop up.
- I learned about debugging and how my logic might be flawed.
